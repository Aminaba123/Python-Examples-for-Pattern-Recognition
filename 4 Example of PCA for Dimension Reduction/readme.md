﻿- This program is designed to show that dimension reduction (or feature extraction) by PCA can improve the performance of linear regression.- [ORL](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html) image dataset is used in this program. - PCA is used to reduce the original dimension (10304) of the training vector to the reduced dimension 9.- It shows that the RMSEs (Root Mean Square Error) of the linear regression are reduced after dimension reduction. It means we can obtain better performances with the extracted features (the dimension is 9) than with the original data (the dimension is 10304). ##### ALWAYS FOR FUN. PLEASE ENJOY ;-)
