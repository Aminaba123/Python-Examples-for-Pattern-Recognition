- ﻿﻿﻿﻿This program is designed to predict the input image containg cats or dogs- This is a two-class classification problem- In this toy problem, we use convolutional neural networks as the classification model- The training data and testing data can be found at [Lintcode](https://www.lintcode.com/ai/)- The training data contains a set of images including both cats and dogs. The labels are also provided with the images.- The testing data only contains a set of unlabeled images.- The code Readindata.py is designed to read in the training data and testing data and store them into "pickle" files.- The code Catog.py is the main program to do the classification.##### ALWAYS FOR FUN. PLEASE ENJOY ;-)
